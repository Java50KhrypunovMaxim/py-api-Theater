2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have python and pip installed. To install dependencies, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set Up Database
The project uses a PostgreSQL database. Create a database and set up the necessary configurations in the settings.py file under the DATABASES section. Ensure that the following environment variables are set: POSTGRES_DB, POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_HOST, and POSTGRES_PORT.

4. Run Migrations

python manage.py migrate
5. Create a Superuser
To access the Django admin interface, create a superuser:

python manage.py createsuperuser
Follow the prompts to set up your superuser account.

6. Run the Project
Start the development server:

python manage.py runserver
Now the API will be accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

Using the API

1. Authentication
To access most endpoints, authentication is required. You can use token-based authentication, which can be generated through the Django Admin or via the API.

2. Example Requests
Get the list of genres:
GET /genres/
Get the list of actors:
GET /actors/
Get the list of plays:
GET /plays/
3. Managing Reservations

4. Request and Response Examples
For each endpoint, detailed request and response examples can be found through the Browsable API, which is available after starting the server.
